This is a terrible Python Tkinter keyboard client. It "sends" keyboard input over NetworkTables. Topics are published for each numpad key, and they are either true or false depending on if the key is pressed. Can be adapted to use any keys on the keyboard.

Licensed under CC0 because this is so terrible.
