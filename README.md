This is a terrible Python Tkinter keyboard client. It "sends" keyboard input over NetworkTables. Topics are published for each numpad key, and they are either true or false depending on if the key is pressed. Can be adapted to use any keys on the keyboard.

Published in the event someone finds this useful; you'll get no support though. There probably won't be any new changes either.

Licensed under CC0 because this is so terrible.
